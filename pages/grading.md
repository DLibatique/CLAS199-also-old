# <a name="gc">Grading Contract</a>

Grading and assessments in this course will be unorthodox. We will be following a form of **specification grading**, in which all assignments and assessments (including quizzes) are graded on a **satisfactory or unsatisfactory** basis. Each assignment and assessment will have an explicit set of guidelines and criteria for what will be considered “satisfactory.” Your semester grade, then, will be based on the number and type of satisfactory assignments and assessments completed. In other words, *you* will be in control of your semester grade — *you* decide the grade that you want and commit as much time or energy towards that grade as you desire.

The following is a rubric for semester-end grades in the course.

|     | **A** | **A-** | **B-** | **C-** | **D-** |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Unexcused Absences | 0 | &le; 2 | &le; 4 | &le; 6 | &le; 8 |
Responses | 14 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 |
Quizzes | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
Final Essay or Exam | X | X | X | X | X |
Creative Projects | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |  

<br>
To achieve a certain grade level, you must complete the listed number of satisfactory assignments or requirements from each of five different categories. For example, if you want a B- for the semester, you must have no more than four unexcused absences, and you must complete 10 responses to secondary readings, 1 creative project, 4 quizzes, a mid-semester essay or exam, and a final essay or exam. When you have completed the minimum number of satisfactory assignments for the final grade that you want, you do not need to submit further examples of that assignment type.

Once you have reached a certain grade level, you can improve within that letter range (e.g., from a B- to a B or a B+) by meeting the criteria for the responses or creative projects in the next grade range. For instance, a student in the B- range would move to a B by completing two more responses OR an additional creative project and would earn a B+ by doing both of those things. Then, at the end of the semester, if the student has completed the requirements for a B+ and accrued no more than 2 unexcused absences, the grade goes up to an A-. If, however, the student has accrued 3 or 4 unexcused absences, the grade remains at B+.

It is possible to make up unsatisfactory assignments. At the beginning of the semester, each student will be allotted three tokens. One token can be used to make up an unsatisfactory response or quiz or to subtract 1 from your number of excused absences, and three tokens are required for another attempt at an unsatisfactory essay, exam, or creative project. No late assignments will be accepted without a documented reason.

# <a name="ap">Absence Policy</a>
You must attend each meeting of the course to attain a good grade. I will be explaining many terms and concepts in class in ways that are not readily available through any other course materials, and your participation in the class’ discussion of the course’s readings and ideas is vital to building a strong classroom and your own foundation of knowledge.

Attendance will be taken via a sign-in sheet at every class meeting. The sign-in sheet is the only way to verify that you were in attendance at class that day.

If you must miss a class meeting for any reason, please inform me as soon as you know of the absence **via e-mail before the class meeting begins**, and we will correspond accordingly. If you notify me before class begins, the absence is considered **excused**. The reasons for an excused absence can range from illness to family emergency to mental health or anything else; you do not need to specify it to me. All I ask is that you notify me via e-mail before the class begins.

Any absence without a notifying e-mail can be considered **excused** for compelling and verifiable reasons (including but not limited to extended illness, a death or medical emergency in the family, a wedding in the immediate family, and participation in a college-sponsored athletic event). Such an absence falls under Holy Cross' Excused Absence Policy and requires a note from your Class Dean. See the full Excused Absence Policy [here](https://catalog.holycross.edu/node/1381/#EAP).

Any absence about which I do not receive an e-mail from you or which is not excused by a note from your Class Dean will be considered **unexcused**.

The semester grading contract takes into account only **unexcused** absences, though I reserve the right to take **excused** absences into account if the student’s number of excused absences become excessive.

# <a name="responses">Response Guidelines</a>

Each written response that you submit as part of your semester portfolio will follow one of three formats: **3-2-1**, **argument analysis**, or **personal reflection**. All three formats should be **1-2pp. double-spaced**. If you go beyond 2 pp., that’s fine too; 1-2pp. is just a general guideline. The response will be graded “satisfactory” if it answers each prompt or question under the appropriate heading.

<span class="underline"><strong>3-2-1</strong></span>  
Write down **three (3)** things that you learned.  
Write down **two (2)** things that you found interesting and want to learn more about.  
Write down **one (1)** thing that was unclear or one question that you still have about the material.  
A 3-2-1 does not need to be written in paragraph form; you can use bullet points or numbered lists.  

<span class="underline"><strong>Argument Analysis</strong></span>  
Answer the following questions:  
- What is the author’s main argument?
- How do they make that argument? What evidence do they provide?
- Do you agree or disagree? Or, put differently, does the author make their case persuasively?

<span class="underline"><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></span>  
If the article speaks to you on a personal level (in terms of gender, sexual orientation, etc.), what resonates with you? How can you connect the topics or ideas in the article to events, relationships, or beliefs in your own life?
<hr>
# <a name="quizzes">Quiz Guidelines</a>

There will be **six (6)** quizzes administered in class throughout the semester at the end of the class period to which it’s assigned. Each quiz will be graded out of 10 points; **a satisfactory grade will be a 7/10 or higher**. The format of the quizzes will vary, from multiple choice to fill in the blank to matching. All quiz-able material will be drawn from the Terms and Concepts sheets distributed each week. Once you complete **four (4)** satisfactory quizzes, you are exempt from taking any remaining quizzes. If you do not complete four satisfactory quizzes within the six administered in class, we will correspond privately about further quiz opportunities.
<hr>
# <a name="finex">Final Exam Guidelines</a>

Towards the end of the semester, you will choose either to write a research essay or take an exam. The final exam will be composed of a combination of multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blanks, and one or two essay questions. Material for the multiple-choice questions and fill-in-the-blanks may be drawn from any of the Terms and Concepts sheets distributed each week of class. Material for the essays may be drawn from any topic discussed in class. The exam will take about an hour and a half to complete. The exam will be graded out of a total of 50 points, and **a satisfactory grade will be 35/50 or higher**. If you opt to take the final exam, you must let me know **by Monday 4/9 via e-mail**, and we will use that e-mail correspondence to determine a time and place for the exam.
<hr>
# <a name="finess">Final Essay Guidelines</a>

For reasons of space, the guidelines for the final essay will be provided directly to those who opt to write it as we get closer to the end of the semester. The final essay will be 5-6pp. double-spaced and encourage you to answer a prompt about gender and sexuality in the ancient world. Sample prompts include:

- How can we define masculinity in ancient Greece or Rome?
- How can we define femininity in ancient Greece or Rome?
- What is considered deviant sexual behavior in ancient Greece or Rome?
- What kinds of sexuality are on display in the writings of [choose author]?

You will be required to draw on at least two primary sources and two secondary sources to write your essay.
<hr>
# <a name="cp">Creative Projects: General Guidelines</a>

I will designate a number of possible projects for you to complete that will draw on your creativity. The tasks range from writing poetry to creating artwork, recording a podcast to recording a video, analyzing an object to looking for ancient gender and sexuality in modern media like movies or music. If you would like to complete a creative project that isn’t listed in the possibilities below, you are more than welcome to pitch your idea for a creative project to me via e-mail or in office hours.
