# <a name="gc">Grading Contract</a>

Grading and assessments in this course will be unorthodox. We will be following a form of **specification grading**, in which all assignments and assessments (including quizzes) are graded on a **satisfactory or unsatisfactory** basis. Each assignment and assessment will have an explicit set of guidelines and criteria for what will be considered “satisfactory.” Your semester grade, then, will be based on the number and type of satisfactory assignments and assessments completed. In other words, *you* will be in control of your semester grade — *you* decide the grade that you want and commit as much time or energy towards that grade as you desire.

The following is a rubric for semester-end grades in the course.

|     | **A** | **A-** | **B-** | **C-** | **D-** |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Unexcused Absences | 0 | &le; 2 | &le; 4 | &le; 6 | &le; 8 |
Responses | 14 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 |
Quizzes | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
Final Essay or Exam | X | X | X | X | X |
Creative Projects | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |  

<br>
To achieve a certain grade level, you must complete the listed number of satisfactory assignments or requirements from each of five different categories. For example, if you want a B- for the semester, you must have no more than four unexcused absences, and you must complete 10 responses to secondary readings, 1 creative project, 4 quizzes, a mid-semester essay or exam, and a final essay or exam. When you have completed the minimum number of satisfactory assignments for the final grade that you want, you do not need to submit further examples of that assignment type.

Once you have reached a certain grade level, you can improve within that letter range (e.g., from a B- to a B or a B+) by meeting the criteria for the responses or creative projects in the next grade range. For instance, a student in the B- range would move to a B by completing two more responses OR an additional creative project and would earn a B+ by doing both of those things. Then, at the end of the semester, if the student has completed the requirements for a B+ and accrued no more than 2 unexcused absences, the grade goes up to an A-. If, however, the student has accrued 3 or 4 unexcused absences, the grade remains at B+.

It is possible to make up unsatisfactory assignments. At the beginning of the semester, each student will be allotted three tokens. One token can be used to make up an unsatisfactory response or quiz or to subtract 1 from your number of excused absences, and three tokens are required for another attempt at an unsatisfactory essay, exam, or creative project. No late assignments will be accepted without a documented reason.

# <a name="ap">Absence Policy</a>
You must attend each meeting of the course to attain a good grade. I will be explaining many terms and concepts in class in ways that are not readily available through any other course materials, and your participation in the class’ discussion of the course’s readings and ideas is vital to building a strong classroom and your own foundation of knowledge.

Attendance will be taken via a sign-in sheet at every class meeting. The sign-in sheet is the only way to verify that you were in attendance at class that day.

If you must miss a class meeting for any reason, please inform me as soon as you know of the absence **via e-mail before the class meeting begins**, and we will correspond accordingly. If you notify me before class begins, the absence is considered **excused**. The reasons for an excused absence can range from illness to family emergency to mental health or anything else; you do not need to specify it to me. All I ask is that you notify me via e-mail before the class begins.

Any absence without a notifying e-mail can be considered **excused** for compelling and verifiable reasons (including but not limited to extended illness, a death or medical emergency in the family, a wedding in the immediate family, and participation in a college-sponsored athletic event). Such an absence falls under Holy Cross' Excused Absence Policy and requires a note from your Class Dean. See the full Excused Absence Policy [here](https://catalog.holycross.edu/node/1381/#EAP).

Any absence about which I do not receive an e-mail from you or which is not excused by a note from your Class Dean will be considered **unexcused**.

The semester grading contract takes into account only **unexcused** absences, though I reserve the right to take **excused** absences into account if the student’s number of excused absences become excessive.

# <a name="responses">Response Guidelines</a>

This requirement asks you to respond to secondary articles or chapters that treat ancient gender and sexuality. A list of articles or chapters to which you can respond is contained in the course bibliography at the end of this syllabus. You are encouraged to write responses to articles or chapters that deal with a topic in which you are interested. So, you may choose to write three responses to the three articles listed in Week 2, or you may opt to write no responses for that week and focus instead on the general interest articles — it’s up to you!

There is no particular due date for any given response; if you feel so inclined, you may, for example, read 14 articles and write 14 responses in the first week of the course and then not have to write any for the remainder. Do keep in mind, though, that the opposite is not true: all responses must be received by **6pm on May 6** (the final day of class), and you may submit **no more than six (6) responses in the space between April 30 and May 6**. So, it behooves you to keep up a regular response submission pattern — if you aim for one response per week, you’ll get to 12-13 responses, with only 1 or 2 more needed for A credit.

Your response should be written in one of three formats: **3-2-1**, **argument analysis**, or **personal reflection**. All three formats should be **1-2pp. double-spaced**. If you go beyond 2 pp., that’s fine too; 1-2pp. is just a general guideline. **The response will be graded “satisfactory” if it answers each prompt or question under the appropriate heading below.**

All responses on textual articles or chapters should be submitted via the [upload portal](resources#up) with the filename convention: **[LAST NAME] - RESPONSE - [AUTHOR LAST NAME] [DATE]**. For example: **Libatique - Response - Herz 2015.pdf**.

All responses on podcasts should be submitted via the [upload portal](resources#up) with the filename convention: **[LAST NAME] - RESPONSE - PODCAST - [PODCAST DESCRIPTION]**. For example: **Libatique - Response - Podcast - History of Ancient Greece on Marriage and Domesticity.pdf**.

<span class="underline"><strong>3-2-1</strong></span>  
Write down **three (3)** things that you learned.  
Write down **two (2)** things that you found interesting and want to learn more about.  
Write down **one (1)** thing that was unclear or one question that you still have about the material.  
A 3-2-1 does not need to be written in paragraph form; you can use bullet points or numbered lists.  

<span class="underline"><strong>Argument Analysis</strong></span>  
Answer the following questions:  
- What is the author’s main argument?
- How do they make that argument? What evidence do they provide?
- Do you agree or disagree? Or, put differently, does the author make their case persuasively?

<span class="underline"><strong>Personal Reflection</strong></span>  
If the article speaks to you on a personal level (in terms of gender, sexual orientation, etc.), what resonates with you? How can you connect the topics or ideas in the article to events, relationships, or beliefs in your own life?

<hr>
# <a name="quizzes">Quiz Guidelines</a>

There will be **six (6)** quizzes administered in class throughout the semester at the end of the class period to which it’s assigned. Each quiz will be graded out of 10 points; **a satisfactory grade will be a 7/10 or higher**. The format of the quizzes will vary, from multiple choice to fill in the blank to matching. All quiz-able material will be drawn from the Terms and Concepts sheets distributed each week. Once you complete **four (4)** satisfactory quizzes, you are exempt from taking any remaining quizzes. If you do not complete four satisfactory quizzes within the six administered in class, we will correspond privately about further quiz opportunities.

<hr>
# <a name="finex">Final Exam Guidelines</a>

Towards the end of the semester, you will choose either to write a research essay or take an exam. The final exam will be composed of a combination of multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blanks, and one or two essay questions. Material for the multiple-choice questions and fill-in-the-blanks may be drawn from any of the Terms and Concepts sheets distributed each week of class. Material for the essays may be drawn from any topic discussed in class. The exam will take about an hour and a half to complete. The exam will be graded out of a total of 50 points, and **a satisfactory grade will be 35/50 or higher**. If you opt to take the final exam, you must let me know **by Monday 4/9 via e-mail**, and we will use that e-mail correspondence to determine a time and place for the exam.

# <a name="finess">Final Essay Guidelines</a>

For reasons of space, the guidelines for the final essay will be provided directly to those who opt to write it as we get closer to the end of the semester. The final essay will be **5-6pp. double-spaced** and encourage you to make and substantiate an argument about gender and sexuality in the ancient world. To be clear, 5-6 pages is not a lot of space; the challenge of this essay is making a persuasive argument using proper primary and scholarly secondary evidence in a small amount of space. Sample prompts include:

- Can we equate the ancient kinaidos / cinaedus with the modern notion of a gay man? Why or why not?
- Can we equate the ancient tribas with the modern notion of a lesbian woman? Why or why not?
- Did Greek women or Roman women possess more social power in their respective cultures?

You will be required to draw on at least two primary sources and two secondary sources to write your essay.

# <a name="cp">Creative Projects: General Guidelines</a>

I will designate a number of possible projects for you to complete that will draw on your creativity. The tasks range from writing poetry to creating artwork, recording a podcast to recording a video, analyzing an object to looking for ancient gender and sexuality in modern media like movies or music. If you would like to complete a creative project that isn’t listed in the possibilities below, you are more than welcome to pitch your idea for a creative project to me via e-mail or in office hours.

All text-based creative projects should be submitted via the submission portal on the course website with the filename convention: [LAST NAME] - CREATIVE PROJECT - [TYPE OF PROJECT]. For example,

**Libatique - Creative Project - Poem.pdf**  
**Libatique - Creative Project - Sappho.pdf**  
etc.

The guidelines for submission of all media-based creative projects is listed under the appropriate heading.

All creative projects must be submitted to me **by 5pm on Thursday, May 9** (the first day of the exam period). There is no due date for any given creative project, but if you do more than one, it behooves you to spread the wealth time-wise, as it were, as some projects may take some time to complete. If you’re going for an A (i.e., completing 4 creative projects), I recommend attempting to complete one every three weeks or so, as we have only about 12-13 full weeks of class.

### <a name="poem">Creative Project 1: Write a Poem.</a>

I will provide a small set of poems regarding gender or sexuality written by ancient Greek and Latin authors. Your goal in this creative project is to choose one author and **write a poem of 30-40 lines about gender or sexuality in their style, capturing their essence by using similar diction, poetic structure, and themes**. The poem’s meter is of your own choosing (even free verse!). The topic of the poem can be personal, drawn from your own life, or more generalized — you can create your own persona! The challenge of this creative project is that you are not allowed to tell me which author you are patterning your poem on — it should be self-evident from the words of your poem. Submit the poem with an original title (that doesn’t tell me which author or poem you are patterning your poem on) according to the submission guidelines above. A grade of satisfactory will be granted if I am able to tell from which poet/poem you drew your inspiration; poetic ability will not necessarily be a factor in the decision, unless it is clear that no effort was put into your poem.

### <a name="art">Creative Project 2: Artistic Rendering.</a>

**Illustrate a scene or object from any of the works we read this semester**, and **write a 5-6 sentence paragraph describing it**, as if it were on display in a museum and the paragraph is its blurb on the wall next to it. Any medium (electronic or physical: paint, pencil, sculpture, etc.) is acceptable. Some suggestions include ____________. I will be looking to see how (and how creatively) you render details of the text into a visual form, rather than evaluating how good of an artist you are. A grade of satisfactory will be granted if it’s clear what scene and what details from that textual account you decided to depict in your artistic rendering.

### <a name="eidolon">Creative Project 3: *Eidolon* Pitch.</a>

You’ll notice that the articles that I chose for your response essays are mostly drawn from the online Classics publication [*Eidolon*](https://eidolon.pub), whose mission is to publish articles by any level of Classics student or teacher (from high school to graduate-level) that explore topics in Classics in various ways: personal and emotional responses to ancient literature and art; the relationship of modern art, music, and literature to ancient Greek and Roman precedents; and so on.

The goal of this creative project is to **draft a pitch for an *Eidolon* article that deals with one of the themes of ancient gender and sexuality that we’re investigating this semester**. The topic can be as broad or as specific as you’d like.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. You must have a witty title. Use existing *Eidolon* article titles as inspiration!
2. The content of the pitch must answer the following questions:
    1. What is the topic that you’d like to write about?
    2. What are at least two examples of primary or secondary sources that you would use in writing about it?
    3. Who is the intended audience for your *Eidolon* piece? The general public? Other college students? People who are knowledgeable about ancient gender and sexuality? People who know nothing about ancient gender and sexuality?
3. The pitch’s length should be about 2-3 pp. double spaced.  

<p class="list">Resources:</p>
- Check out *Eidolon*’s [instructions for pitching and their recommendations on what make a good pitch](https://eidolon.pub/how-to-pitch-especially-to-eidolon-7d925eec669).
- Make sure to read a few *Eidolon* articles first to get a sense of what topics an article can cover and how an author works with both primary and secondary evidence.

### <a name="oa">Creative Project 4: Selfie and Object Analysis.</a>

This creative project challenges you to **choose an object in the Greek or Roman rooms at the Worcester Art Museum and relate it to the themes of ancient gender and sexuality that we are discussing in the course**. You get free admission to the WAM with your Holy Cross ID. If you would like to complete an object analysis for an ancient Greek or Roman artifact from another museum (e.g., the Museum of Fine Art in Boston or the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York), that works too! Simply let me know that you’d like to visit one of those institutions, and I can help you locate an appropriate object.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. Visit the WAM, and locate one of the following objects:
    - in the Greek room (up the stairs from the Worcester Hunt mosaic)
    - in the Roman room (in the back left room from the Worcester Hunt)
2. Take a selfie with your located object.
3. Answer the following questions:
    1. What is your object?
    2. When was it made? (Century of creation is fine if there is no more specific information available than that.)
    3. What material is it made out of?
    4. Where was it originally displayed?
    5. Which themes of ancient gender and sexuality does the object tie into? How?
4. The answers may be formatted either in paragraph/essay form or in bullet points — whatever format enables you to make your points most clearly yet concisely.
5. There is no page minimum or maximum, though a general guidelines of about 2-3pp. double spaced is good to aim for.
6. Submit the selfie and the essay to me via e-mail.

### <a name="pod">Creative Project 5: Podcast Lesson.</a>

The goal of this creative project is to **create a podcast in which you talk about a topic that relates to ancient Greek or Roman gender or sexuality**. The topic can be as specific (e.g., what is Aristophanes' speech in Plato's *Symposium* about?) or general (e.g., who were *cinaedi*?) as you want to make it. The challenge of this creative project is articulating important details about your topic with only audio: your voice, sound clips, music, etc.

The criteria for a grade of satisfactory are as follows:
1. The content of the podcast must focus on explaining a topic that relates to ancient Greek or Roman gender or sexuality. Imagine an audience that knows nothing about but wants to learn about your chosen topic.
2. The topic may be drawn from any topic discussed or mentioned in Ormand, in a secondary reading, or in class.
3. In the podcast, you must write and use your own script — you cannot, e.g., simply read passages from Ormand aloud.
4. If you quote or paraphrase a source, you must explicitly mention the name of the author or the source that you used in the podcast script.
5. The podcast should be accompanied by a bibliography of sources, even if you use only Ormand.
6. The length of the podcast must be between 4 to 6 minutes.
7. The format of the podcast should be electronic, in an .mp3 or .aiff format.
8. The podcast should be uploaded to an external site, like Soundcloud, and accessible via a public link.
9. Submit the public link to me via e-mail.

Resources and Tips:
- The best software to use to record the podcast would be [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). It’s free and relatively intuitive to use! Guidelines on using Audacity to record a podcast can be found [here](https://podcast.co/create/record-a-podcast).
- You can (and are encouraged to) use the **Media Suites** at the **Multimedia Resource Center** in Stein 324 to record your podcasts. Check out [this link](https://www.holycross.edu/multimedia-resource-center/media-suites-multimedia-resource-center) for information and for the portal to reserve a suite.
- Make sure to use the podcasts assigned for the course as an inspiration for podcast style and content.
